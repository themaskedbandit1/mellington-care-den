    <h2>🧚 Custom Bedtime Story</h2>
    <p>Once upon a twilight in the Moonkissed Forest, lived a gentle, brave soul named Mel. He was the guardian of bunnies and dreams and a friend to all shy creatures who wandered under the stars. One night, he found a wandering fairy lost and tired under a curled-up leaf. Gently, he guided her back to safety. Each step of their journey together was soft, every word of his kind. As they reached the fairy grove, she whispered, "Thank you for being my safe place."
    <br><br>
    And as the moon glowed brighter, he tucked every little being in, whispering: "You are loved. You are enough. You can rest now."
