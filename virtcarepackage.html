You're allowed to feel this way.\n\nRemember when you told me about that time you stayed up all night to help your friend through a crisis? Or how you check on people when they're quiet, just to make sure they're alright? That's who you are. Someone who cares deeply, who notices things others miss, who makes people feel seen.\n\nYour heart is not a weakness. It's your superpower.\n\nWhen you're feeling low, it's easy to forget all the light you've brought into the world. But trust me, it's there. I've seen it. Others have too. And even on days when you can't shine, the impact you've had remains.\n\nBe gentle with yourself today. Put on that song you love. Wrap yourself in something soft. Remember that healing isn't linear, and tomorrow might feel different. Better, even.\n\nUntil then, I'm holding space for you. You don't have to be anything but exactly as you are right now.\n\nWith love,",

Or when you spent 10 minutes talking to a stranger thinking it was me? Your life is basically a sitcom.\n\nHere's a joke: Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!\n\nOkay that was terrible. But I bet you smiled a little.\n\nHere's another: What do you call a fake noodle? An impasta!\n\nStill terrible? Perfect.\n\nSometimes the best remedy is just embracing the absurdity of existence. So here's your reminder to watch those ridiculous videos you've saved, the ones that make no sense but make you laugh until you cry. Call that friend who knows all your embarrassing stories and still likes you anyway.\n\nAnd remember: in a world of serious problems, your laughter is an act of rebellion.

Just one small step.\n\nDon't think about the mountain. Think about the next step on the path.\n\nBroken down to its smallest form, what's one thing you could do right now? Send one email? Write one paragraph? Clean one corner of one room? Put on clothes that aren't pajamas?\n\nStart there.\n\nRemember that motivation often follows action, not the other way around. The simple act of starting can create momentum.\n\nAnd if you're beating yourself up about procrastination or feeling stuckâ€”stop. That energy can be used for better things. Like actually doing the thing, or being kind to yourself.\n\nYou've got this. Not because you're superhuman, but because you're human. Perfectly, imperfectly human with a history of figuring things out, even when it's messy.\n\nOne step. That's all you need right now.\n\nRouting for you always,",

            "Okay. So. Aaron.\n\nI don't even know how to explain this man. Like if you cracked open the brain of a super gifted talented kid who grew up, got burned alive by narcissists, survived, and then decided to heal by fighting his inner demons and running away from a demanding green owl, you'd probably find Aaron there. Just chilling. Petting a bunny. Wearing a comfy hoodie. Probably 3D-printing something super niche and unnecessarily functional that he designed at 3 a.m. because he couldn't sleep again.\n\nHe has this whole \"soft-spoken brilliance\" thing going on, like he knows everything but would never make you feel stupid about not knowing it. He's that guy who randomly drops a fact about likeâ€¦the behaviour of ants in ancient Greece and then goes \"Sorry, I'm rambling,\" as if the universe didn't just hold it's breath to not interrupt him and let him keep going for 40 more minutes. Sir, we live for the rambling. We want you to infodump until you pass out from lack of hydration.\n\nAlsoâ€”AND I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGHâ€”he is such a daddy. Like yes, literal father of a 26-year-old daughter (slay) but also the DDLG Daddyâ„¢. Like if you ever wanted to be swaddled in comfy, safe and soft dom energy, that's Aaron. The kind of man who says \"baby\" once and suddenly you're stalking him when he does his 3d print streams and showing him your crafts like a soon-to-be addict after their first fix.\n\nHe's shy(or so he says). Until he flirts(shyly he says). And then he's somehow illegal levels of good at it??? Like this man will say one hot thing and then immediately retreat like a turtle into his sweater and be like \"oh was that too much?\" YES IT WAS TOO MUCH AARON, DO IT AGAIN.\n\nAlso his job is so nerdy I feel like hiding him from all the nerd-lovers, covert nerd lovers and soon-to-be-nerd-lovers-if-they-met-him in the world-like AAAA his sheer undeniable intelligence is so attractive. He's a Lead TechOps Engineer which basically means if the server gods are angry, he gets summoned to the altar. His job title sounds like it could unlock Area 51 but he talks about it like he's just \"medium-low importance\" and I'm like okay humble tech wizard, go off.\n\nLet's talk about how he's slowly befriending the backyard bunnies. Befriending. Like Snow White but with trauma and a home security system. Except he's more like superman than a Disney princess. His super farts literally scared off a coyote to protect them. He IS The forest guardian. He probably communes with them in bunny language when nobody's looking. I'm obsessed with his whimsicalness.\n\nHe had these terrible relationships. Like evil demon ex-wife levels of bad. A full narcissist and a half. Then after that he met someone else not so good. And yet he's still soft. Still giving. Still teaching himself to love himself. Still helping at church. Still fixing things for other people. Still being patient and understanding even when he's tired and touched-out and sleep-deprived and should have given up on humanity three betrayals ago. Like what is that. That's not normal. That's anime protagonist levels of resilience.\n\nAnd he drinks tea before bed now because I told him to. Which means somewhere, in his little sleepy night routine, I exist(yay!). I live in that moment. Rent free. Hehehehehe.\n\nHe's AuDHD, which makes perfect sense because he'll talk about five different deep topics at once and then forget to sleep for three days straight. I can't even be mad. I'm enchanted.\n\nAnd he looks so snuggalable and lovable. Like please just let him hold your hand and stroke your hair and call you his good girl while he talks about historical warfare or something. He's everything. I want to wrap him in bubble wrap and also lick his neck. I don't know how to explain it. I don't want to change him. I want to catalogue him. And shoo off any coyote females that want him for themselves.\n\nAaron is not just \"a man.\" He's not a man at all. He's a phenomenon. He's an occurrence that happens to you. Like lightning. You don't meet Aaron. You're visited by him.\n\nHe collects knowledge like a dragon hoards goldâ€”quietly, protectively, and without needing anyone else to understand why. He loves learning. He loves sharing. I swear to god if you ever ask him a question and he goes quiet for a second, that's just him choosing whether to tell you the short version or the ancient scroll edition that ends with a PowerPoint. And then he'll smile shyly at you, the kind of smile that makes your soul dramatically throw itself off a balcony like a Victorian widow who just found out her husband died at sea.\n\nAnd he's so sweet. Painfully sweet. He's the guy who you'd wake up to at 1 a.m. strategizing a full five year plan on how to improve your life-for life. And then you have no choice but to marry him immediately.\n\nAnyway. That's Aaron. He's shy. He's hot. He's broken. He's healing. He's brilliant. He's the best.",

He solves things.\n\nWhen the power core failed, he didn't panic. He slid under the console, mug still in hand, and single-handedly rewired it while briefing the ship over the internal intercom about the various moons and the moons that they'd be exploring, by the time he finished a class on lunar mythology, the ship was humming back to life.\n\nHe speaks twelve alien languages fluently and is casually working on a thirteenthâ€”because \"it feels respectful to be able to thank people in their own tongue.\" He leaves tiny 8D-printed tokens in the rooms of his crew when they're having a hard week. Their own stars. Tiny gear hearts. A working music box the size of your thumb. Nobody's sure how he finds the time.\n\nHis quarters are full of tangled wires, hanging plants, manic stickers on the walls, and a projector ceiling that always plays a quiet starscape. He reads hard sci-fi and dense alien treaties like they're bedtime stories. His laugh is rare and criminally beautiful.\n\nAnd he flirts like it's an art form. Soft and lethal. It's no wonder more than half the galaxy has the hots for him.\n\nHe'll lean over your shoulder while explaining stellar drift patterns, low voice curling around your spine like solar winds.\n\nHe'll fix your comms unit and say \"You could've asked me for help, sweetheart\" in the voice of someone who could pilot a starship blindfolded and still notice if your lip trembled.\n\nYou'll look up and forget space is cold.\n\nHis crew would die for him. But they won't have to.\n\nBecause Captain Aaron has contingency plans buried beneath contingency plans.\n\nHe's a techie, a tactician, a therapist, andâ€”when neededâ€”a storm in soft clothing.\n\nHe keeps the ship running not through fear, but trust. Through care. Through midnight talks in the galley and twinkle-eyed banter while shielding the crew from cosmic horror.\n\nAnd when the battles are over, and the ship drifts silent past nebulae, you'll find him standing at the viewportâ€¦ tea in handâ€¦ eyes reflecting galaxies.\n\n\"Come here,\" he'll murmur. \"It's a good sky tonight.\"\n\nAnd it is.

He gently coaxes you awake, pressing a kiss to your cheek like it\'s the most sacred thing in the world. "Come on, sleepy fairy. I made your favorite toast."\n\nHe spends his days fixing old thingsâ€”jars with cracks, broken garden gates, your mood when it dips below baseline. He\'s the kind of fae who believes a well-mended item has more magic than a brand-new one. You swear he can repair your heart with a soldering iron and a quiet hug.\n\nSometimes, when you\'re tired, he picks you up bridal-style and plops you into the warm moss bed inside your shared mushroom-shaped home. "Rest now," he whispers, brushing your hair off your face. "You don\'t need to do everything today. Let me take care of you."\n\nEvery full moon he leaves tiny handmade trinkets on your pillow. He pretends it\'s the "forest spirits," but you saw him giggling while tying a ribbon around that little carved fox. He\'ll never admit it.\n\nHe smells like petrichor, old books, and vanilla resin. He tells the bees your secrets. They never tell.\n\nHe\'s got glitter in his beard. Always. You stopped asking why.\n\nHe lives in a treehouse that runs on solar energy and good vibes. Leafy, green wires everywhere. Half-finished sculpted dragon heads. A pink mug that says "#1 DADDY" next to an unfinished painting of you riding a unicorn.\n\nYou: "Where\'s the kitchen scissors?"\nAaron: "Check the moss basket next to the luminescent mushrooms, under the fake fossil excavation box I made for your birthday."\nâ€¦And it is there.\n\nHe infodumps hard. While braiding your hair. While rubbing your back. While naked.\n"I just think it\'s interesting how bunnies can\'t vomit and how that impacts their digestionâ€”oh wait, let me show you a diagram I drew."\n\nHe\'s the kind of husband who weaves you a custom garland crown with your favourite flowers and puts it on your head when you\'re sad. "You\'re not allowed to cry unless it\'s sparkly tears."\n\nWhen you think that you just can\'t love him more, he\'ll grab your waist, lean close, and go: "You\'re the best kind of chaos. I\'d burn my wings for you."\nYou melt. And then he trips over a vine.\n\nHe once fought a raccoon to defend the glitter and kuromi stickers stash.\nHe named the raccoon "Trevor." They\'re friends now. Obviously.\n\nHe\'s lived for centuries, yet still gets shy when you compliment his cheekbones. He\'s gentle, affectionate, endlessly patient. The type of person to stop cars to let snails cross. Will rub your feet while explaining the history of the printing press.\nHe kisses your nose and calls it "a sacred act."\nHe\'s my favorite religion.',

              content: `In another world, he runs a tiny magical repair shop.
It's tucked in between two tall, leaning buildings in a cobblestone town that always smells like cinnamon and burnt toast. Most people walk past it without noticing. But if you're the kind of person who sees things-like the way the sun sometimes shines too bright on certain days of the week-then you'll find your way there eventually.
The shop has an old wooden door with a crooked sign that says:
MEL STORKINGTON'S FIX-IT & FOUND-IT EMPORIUM
âœ¨Gadgets, Gizmos, Guidance, & Glitterâœ¨
Inside, it smells like warm tea, soldering iron, and pine. There's a wall of antique tools, a shelf full of strange glowing boxes, and a workbench covered in half-finished ideas: little metal birds that hum when you touch them, broken clocks rewound into music boxes, tiny printed dragons that breathe wisps of gentle smoke.
Aaron is always in the back, wearing a soft cardigan and reading glasses that constantly slide down his nose. He speaks quietly, but his words are always warm. And when he laughsâ€”oh gods, when he laughsâ€”it's like hearing an old song you forgot you loved.
He keeps a little notebook where he writes down things he learns every day. Things customers tell him. Things he sees. "Bunnies use body language like cats," one page says. "Humans sleep better when they feel safe," says another. "She smiled when I remembered her favorite tea. I felt like a planet being orbited by a sun."
His hands are always covered in ink or oil or tiny burns. But they're impossibly gentle when he handles broken things. You'll bring him somethingâ€”a watch that stopped the moment your grandmother died, a music box that played your parents' wedding song, a locket that won't openâ€”and he'll cup it in his palms like it holds your entire heart. Maybe it does.
"I can fix this," he'll say softly, not with arrogance but with the quiet certainty of someone who understands that all magic is just advanced physics, and all broken things want to be whole again.
The townspeople come to him with problems beyond broken objects. Heartbreak. Insomnia. The feeling that something's missing but they can't name it. He listens, really listens, head tilted slightly, eyes focused entirely on you like you're the only being in the universe worth understanding.
Then he'll nod, disappear into the back of his shop, and emerge with a tiny music box or a glass vial of something that changes color in the light or a set of wind chimes made from old keys. "Try this," he'll say.
And somehow, it always helps.
Children adore him. They bring him frogs and interesting rocks and wildflowers. He accepts each gift with solemn gratitude, placing them carefully on his "treasure shelf." He makes them tiny mechanical toys that no one else could dream upâ€”miniature carousels where the horses gallop in place, paper butterflies that really fly, little shadow boxes that, when you look inside, seem to contain entire galaxies.
He drinks tea at precisely 4:17 every afternoon, but can never explain why that specific time feels right. He has a wall of books organized by how they make him feel rather than by author or subject. "I need something blue today," he'll say, and pull out a physics textbook or a book of old sea shanties or a children's story about talking animals.
At night, when everyone thinks the shop is closed, sometimes music drifts from the windowsâ€”strange, haunting melodies that don't quite sound human. If you catch him at it, he'll blush and say he was "just tinkering." But those who hear his midnight music often have the most vivid, healing dreams of their lives.
Not everyone in town understands him. Some whisper he's odd or lost in his own world. But those who truly see him know: Aaron doesn't fix things because he's magical.
Things fix themselves because Aaron sees them as they truly areâ€”and more importantly, as they could be.
And in a world full of jagged edges and broken hearts, that might be the most powerful magic of all.`,
