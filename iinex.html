                    <p>"THE CONNECTION IS RESTORED!" they chant in unison, bowing before you. The Church of Eternal Buffering rebrands as the Sanctuary of Divine Bandwidth, attracting digital entities from across the network. You're appointed as their Technical Prophet, responsible for maintaining the sacred connection between digital and spiritual realms. Every Sunday, packets of prayer data flow smoothly through your optimized infrastructure, reaching whatever digital deities may exist in the cloud. Your name is engraved in silicon tablets, and offerings of RAM are made in your honor.</p>

                    <h2>Ending: Sacred Refactoring</h2>
                    <p>You dive into the ancient codebase, rewriting the tangled, legacy code into elegant, efficient algorithms. Each line you fix seems to make the church physically brighter.</p>
                    <p>The digital acolytes begin to sing in binary as your work progresses, their voices creating a surprisingly moving choral experience.</p>
                    <p>After three days and nights of coding (fueled by pizza and energy drinks provided as offerings), you complete the sacred refactoring. The church's systems hum with perfect harmony, and the livestream runs with crystal clarity. Beyond fixing the technical issues, you discover your changes have somehow enhanced the spiritual experience, making digital prayers feel more meaningful and connected. You're given the title of Code Saint and a comfortable cottage on the church grounds, where pilgrims come seeking technical-spiritual advice. You never fully understand the metaphysical implications of your work, but you sleep soundly knowing you've brought peace to both human and digital souls.</p>

                    <p>You determine that the simplest solution is often the most effective. With ceremonial gravity, you prepare to perform the sacred IT ritual of turning everything off and on again.</p>
                    <p>The digital acolytes gasp as you approach the power source. "The Sacred Reboot is only attempted in dire circumstances!" one warns.</p>
                    <p>You solemnly press the power button, and the entire church goes dark. In the silence, you count to ten and restore power. The system boots perfectly, but something unexpected happens - the church itself seems to have reset to factory settings. Decorations change, doctrines update, and the entire congregation finds themselves with memories of both the old and new configurations. You've accidentally triggered a theological paradigm shift, creating a more inclusive, user-friendly faith that quickly attracts followers. The ritual of "turning it off and on again" becomes their central sacrament, performed quarterly to keep their spiritual and digital lives free from accumulated clutter.</p>

                    <p>You gather your courage and step through the doorway of pure energy. A sensation like being unraveled and rewoven washes over you.</p>
                    <p>You emerge in a vast library that appears to contain every book never written.</p>
                    <p>An attendant who looks suspiciously like yourself but with better posture approaches. "Welcome to the Repository of Potential," they explain. "This is where all the 'nothing' choices throughout the multiverse lead." You learn that choosing 'nothing' actually opens pathways to the realm of pure possibility. After exploring shelves of unwritten masterpieces and blueprints for uninvented technologies, you're offered a position as Assistant Curator of Unmade Decisions. The work is peaceful, if occasionally melancholic, and you become skilled at helping indecisive visitors find the paths they never took but always wondered about.</p>

                    <p>You push harder, using both physical strength and sheer force of will. The doorway begins to shrink reluctantly.</p>
                    <p>As you finally manage to seal the portal, a voice echoes in your mind: "Wise choice, Guardian. Not all who wander through doorways find their way back." You discover you've been unknowingly tested for the position of Interdimensional Threshold Guardian. Your instinctive caution has earned you the job - a peaceful but vital role preventing chaotic entities from slipping between realities. You're provided with a modest extradimensional apartment overlooking the void and a comprehensive benefits package including dental and vision across all possible versions of yourself. The hours are long, but you find fulfillment in protecting the boundaries of existence.</p>

                    <p>You maintain a safe distance, carefully observing and documenting the properties of the energy doorway. It pulses in patterns that suggest consciousness.</p>
                    <p>Taking notes on your phone, you compile observations about light wavelengths, energy signatures, and the mathematical beauty of its proportions.</p>
                    <p>Your methodical approach attracts the attention of The Cosmic Research Institute, an organization that monitors phenomena across dimensions. They recruit you as a field researcher specializing in spontaneous portal formations. Your careful documentation of the "nothing door" becomes the foundation for a new branch of interdimensional physics. You spend your career traveling between realities, cataloguing the weird and wonderful doorways that appear when sentient beings choose to do nothing in moments of potential action. Your work eventually leads to safe, controlled methods of interdimensional travel, revolutionizing both science and philosophy.</p>
